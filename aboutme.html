<p>I am horticulturalist who loves plantation,
    And plants one for every year on my birthday.
</p>
<h2>Favorite book: Rich Dad Poor Dad</h2>
<P>I like the book as it opens up senses about money, investment, finance and spending habits. 
    It motivates to learn beyond school teachings and work smart.
